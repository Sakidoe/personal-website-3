# Life as an Operational Support @ UCD Computer Lab Management
Beginning in July of 2023, I began my on-site lab internship as an Operational Support worker. 
This job is a collection of many responsibilities, both technical and customer facing. Daily work
was to travel to different onsite computer labs to repair computers, solve general issues, run command-line
scripts on printers and PC Terminals, and much more.

## PC Issue Resolutions

The main part of this job is coming into the office and turning on the work portal to view to issue logs. Many issues
are categorized as recognized(spotted and reported), ongoing(someone is currently/ has tried fixing it), or complete.
Most are completed with a simple Level 2 restore(restoring the computer through a OS restore), but some need a Level 1
restore.(command line prompts that take a backup imaged OS, and replace the faulty OS). Creating issue tickets, and working
with coworkers to diagnose and resolve issues are all daily tasks. I would say the biggest thing I learned is to take the time
to read the Knowledge Base of a workplace, as it saves days of diagnosing as someone else has already done it.

In the job we call it 'janitorial work,' as it really is just 
services we do for the school that isn't really on the job description. We collect giant computer shipments, decommision 
labs, upgrade computers, oversee lab sanitation, and other work that makes the labs up to date and ready for customers.
