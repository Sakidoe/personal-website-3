# Leading the Badminton Team @ UC Davis to Record Numbers of Members and Fourth Nationally!
Starting as a hobby, I've played badminton since Freshman year of highschool. Coming into College as an
international student from Canada during Covid-19, it was one of the few chances I had to exercise, interact
in-person with others, and make life long friends. This lead me to have a deep connection with the club, and I 
wanted to give back by taking leadership positions and using my talents in whatever form to help better the club.

## Projects
As one of the only Computer Science players on the team, I noticed that there were a lot of oppotunities for my skills
to be applied into our systems to better the lives of officers, as well as automate events for us. From creating programs
that communicated with the databases of industry applications like Tournament Software, HTML/SCSS Webpages, backend Python
algorithms, and other programming styles, I used my role as an officer as a way to progress my programming abilities as well
as to help the club.

The Davis Open Scheduling Software was the first program I worked with with others. When I began, learning to push/pull on Git
and program together with those more experienced than me were all crucial learning opportunities for me. The annual Davis Open
is one of Northern California's largest tournaments, held in a stadium setting at Davis. This meant that the vast 17 courts that 
were available were separated to two floors physically, making it difficult to logistically direct the tournament and truly knowing
which courts are free. This communication barrier, along with the inexperience from the officers due to COVID made it so that using the
dated Tournament Software and their sorting systems cost us a lot of money from delays and bad time management. Adding a webpage that allows
players to see when their match is called, alongside a more hands-on algorithm that allows us to dictate and choose times for all players to play
their games made it possible to increase player count and reduce the number of officers working.

An issue that came up was at 2:00am one day before the tournament, I realised that the .XLSX datasets had only compiled half of all the matches,
meaning that only half of the >1000 matches were being counted. Our officer team immediately contacted two industry friends that with me, realised that
the program that we had forked this original algorithm for only allowed for 64 players per bracket, when some of our brackets had 100+ people. By rewriting the
algorithm to allow higher counted arrays and consider more player nodes solved the issue. The issue was solved < 12 hours before game day, teaching me to always
plan ahead and check for any errors days in advanced to never go through that again.

## Club Achievements

Over my time since 2021 at BUCD, I've been able to create and complete so many goals as both a collegiate competitive player, and a leader.
During my first two years of college, we participated against meets with nearly every collegiate badminton team(UCSC, UC Berkeley, Stanford, SJSU), and 
would almost always come out on top! As a Travel Coordinator my Sophomore year of college, I created my first custom algorithm for the team, as well as
plan to logistics behind the first Irvine team trip.

In my Junior year, we took part in USA's first Badminton National Collegiate tournament. Our team won the first Northern California Regionals Tournament,
and took a trip to Boston to play against schools like Cornell, NYU, and Boston Uni!

In my Senior year, we came fourth nationally in the Nationals Tournament, and I released my very first webpage, www.ucdavisbadminton.com!
