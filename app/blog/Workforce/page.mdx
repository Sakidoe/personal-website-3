# Daily Tasks as an Assistant Student Administrator @ UC Davis
Beginning in November of 2024, I began my position at the Windows Administration Group of UC Davis Information Education Technology. 
With other interns, we support the System
 Administrators with various documentation tasks, both technically and organizationally.
 The Windows Administration Group of UC Davis has 60+ Servers that they maintain and update for their clients. Clients include the UCD Research Center,
 International Student & Scholars(SISS), DEVAR, and more.

## Splunk
The main task of this job revolved around programming in Splunk. The WAG group imports data weekly through Sharepoint and XLS Sheets into 
Splunk, which then can be visualized through dashboards and reports. Having taken several advanced Splunk training programs through opportunities
on campus, I am constantly assigned the task to create Splunk Dashboards for specific clients and system admins to send to our clients.

Each dashboard for a particular service is completed through Dashboard Studio, which is a new IDE created by Splunk for dashboard coding in JSON. 
Dashboards all contain login metrics by scraping each attempt logged, and the IP of where they originate from. They also include Tenable and Logic Monitor Metrics,
and a server list that can route to a sub-dashboard which has more particular information of individual servers.

I've also created dashboards for WAG through the original Splunk dashboard programming(XLS code). It shows the overall health of every service that WAG oversees, and
allows server Admins to immediately see where issues may have occurred, highlighting failed logins and Tenable updates.

## Sys Admin Work
Part of my job is to learn side by side with all system admins on my team to understand the tasks which they handle, which gives me context to assist them. Each admin
works on different services handled by WAG and their clients, which means the databases and services they aid with are all different. Most admins run services through AWS,
while others use physical databases on campus, or even Docker. Attending routing meetings with clients and listening to how these services could be improved are ways I am 
assigned tasks, allowing me to handle tasks that are directly effecting the products WAG produces.

## Tenable Security Center

Another task that I run is running Tenable Scans, and creating tickets through the results of those scans. Vulnerabilities that are detected are then catalogged by IP, and
if the severity of vulnerabilities exceeds a certain threshold, tickets are made through ServiceNow to immediately alert teams to view and solve the issues.

## ServiceNow, Sharepoint, Slack

The service I interact with the most is ServiceNow. Creating Reports of each Server and it's configuration items to send to clients by schedule, as well as creating triaging
incidents, creating Test Restore Templates, and incident tickets to other sys admins. This, alongside editing Sharepoint Sheets and pings on Slack are how I cooperate and document
for the team as an assistant system admin.
